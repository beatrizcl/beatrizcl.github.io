      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Software Developer with solid experience in <strong>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong>, backend development, and systems integration. I have worked both as an in-house developer and as a freelance RPA consultant for companies in Brazil and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background includes designing automation for large healthcare institutions and developing machine-level algorithms in aerospace manufacturing. While my experience spans multiple areas of software engineering, my current professional focus is on <strong>RPA and intelligent process automation</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about optimizing workflows, eliminating manual tasks, and delivering scalable, high-impact automation solutions. I am actively seeking <strong>international opportunities</strong> where I can contribute as an RPA specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside work, I enjoy playing piano, studying languages, board games, cycling, and volunteering as a catechist.

              FUZZY: Development of a Shell for the Construction of Diffuse Systems Models
          </a>
          </h3>
          <p><strong>Riuni – UNISUL · Jun 23, 2020</strong></p>
          <p>
          This article presents the development of a Shell for the automatic generation of Fuzzy systems,
          which allows the definition of linguistic variables, relevance degrees, and rules used in the
          Fuzzification and De-fuzzification processes. It was tested by Computer Science students at Unisul
          and compared to a consolidated framework. Results showed its effectiveness in handling imprecise data
          and supporting decisions in fuzzy systems.
