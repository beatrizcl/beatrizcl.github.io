      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Software Developer with solid experience in <strong>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong>, backend development, and systems integration. I have worked both as an in-house developer and as a freelance RPA consultant for companies in Brazil and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background includes designing automation for large healthcare institutions and developing machine-level algorithms in aerospace manufacturing. While my experience spans multiple areas of software engineering, my current professional focus is on <strong>RPA and intelligent process automation</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about optimizing workflows, eliminating manual tasks, and delivering scalable, high-impact automation solutions. I am actively seeking <strong>international opportunities</strong> where I can contribute as an RPA specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside work, I enjoy playing piano, studying languages, board games, cycling, and volunteering as a catechist.

        <!-- BlinkAccess Project -->
        <article class="project-card">
        <h3>BlinkAccess – Eye Blink Control for People with Motor Paralysis</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine being able to control a computer using only your eyes — even when the rest of your body cannot move.
          BlinkAccess is a system that combines my passion for technology with my desire to help others and make life easier.
          It allows individuals with total motor paralysis to interact with a computer and call for help using simple eye blinks.
          New tasks can be added easily, and because it’s open source, anyone can access and contribute to it.
          While many people see RPA as something that “takes jobs away,” I see it as a powerful tool to give people dignity, autonomy, and a better life — letting computers handle the hard work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a regular webcam and intelligent algorithms, BlinkAccess detects different blink patterns to execute essential commands such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calling for medical assistance with specific blink sequences</li>
          <li>Playing and pausing music on YouTube</li>
          <li>Navigating commands easily and intuitively</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system combines advanced computer vision techniques with operating system automation and voice feedback to provide an accessible, lightweight, and easy-to-use experience — all running in real-time on a standard laptop.
        </p>
        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <p>
          BlinkAccess uses the webcam to track the user’s face with MediaPipe technology, identifying key eye landmarks. Based on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) metric, it recognizes short and long blinks, interpreting them as commands to control computer actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure safety and reduce errors, the system includes confirmation modes activated by long blinks, automatic rest periods, and audio feedback that guides the user through every step.
        </p>
        <h4>Why BlinkAccess?</h4>
        <p>
          This project is a real social solution with the potential to improve the quality of life for people with limited mobility by providing autonomy and safety through technology.
          Its clean and modular codebase allows for future enhancements and adaptation to diverse assistive needs.
        </p>

          <h3>Fuzzy Shell for Decision Support Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Final graduation project developed with Paulo R. E. de Oliveira Jr. for our B.Sc. in Computer Science.
            The goal was to build a reusable Shell capable of generating fuzzy logic systems with a graphical interface,
            enabling experts from any domain to model decision-making processes involving uncertainty and imprecise data.
            <br><br>
            We implemented a fuzzy inference engine supporting trapezoidal membership functions and rule evaluation using
            Mamdani-style logic (Min/Max operators). The system includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Definition of linguistic variables and fuzzy sets</li>
              <li>Creation of fuzzy rules using AND/OR logic</li>
              <li>Inference calculation and defuzzification via the Centroid method</li>
              <li>Web interface built with Django for model management and simulation</li>
            </ul>
            Users can define input/output variables, create inference rules, test different scenarios, and view results graphically.
            The prototype was validated with 25 students and compared to the JFuzzyLogic framework, proving effective and intuitive.
